# asv_tree_builder
Using 16S sequencing data and a comprehensive reference database, an automated snakemake pipeline to seamlessly integrate steps from sequence retrieval to vizualising the evolutionary relationship among ASVs.

Note that due to the upload structure on github, after cloning/downloading, you will need to move the "V4" folder into the "all_required_tree_building_files_FL16SDB" folder so the path will look like this: "all_required_tree_building_files_FL16SDB/V4" . Please contact me if you have any questions or issues about this.
